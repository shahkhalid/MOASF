Multi-Objective Academic Search Framework for Determining the Usefulness of Papers.

In this experiment, we assume that the usefulness of a paper is determined not only by its relevance to the query but also by other aspects including its publication age and impact in the research community. This Multi-objective approach takes into account these aspects in the strategic of the approach. for evaluation, group of evaluation metrics are proposed and developed to measure the usefulness of a ranked list of papers. When defining these metrics, three factors, including relevance, publication age, and impact, are considered at the same time. To accommodate this, we propose a framework to rank papers by a combination of their relevance, publication age,	and impact scores.
